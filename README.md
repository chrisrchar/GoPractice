# Go Class Code
This repo holds code from a Udemy class on learning the syntax and structures of GoLang. The class can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/).

# Projects
## Cards
The first project in the class meant to familiarize with Go's syntax and how functions work inside packages. Created a custom **deck** type with functions to simulate a card deck. Also used Go's io package to read and write the deck slice to local disk

## Even and Odd
The first assignment in the class. Simple code that iterates through an array to determine if the number in the array is even or odd then prints the result to the console.

## Structs
Code introducing structs and also writing functions with pointers. Includes embedded structs and a function to update a struct.

## Map
Code introducing maps and how to use them. Also showing how they differ from structs based on strict typing and being pass by reference.
